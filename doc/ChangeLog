One-line Summary: Avoid glacier dynamic landunit adjustments in first time step

Purpose of changes
------------------

Always avoid generating dynamic landunit adjustments for glacier area
changes in the first timestep of a startup or hybrid run - not just for
cold start or interpolated start. See the detailed discussion in
https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/issues/340 for rationale.

    cheyenne_intel ---- ok
    cheyenne_gnu ------ pass
    hobart_nag -------- pass
    hobart_pgi -------- pass
    hobart_intel ------ pass

    ok means tests pass; baseline failures as expected in these two

    - seems to have come from an finidat_interp_dest file, and thus does
    not match the glacier area from CISM.)

CTSM tag used for the baseline comparisons: ctsm1.0.dev006


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Startup / Hybrid runs that include CISM
     (even NOEVOLVE) and do not use init_interp, due to:
     - different PE layout in new case vs. the one that generated the
       finidat (roundoff-level diffs)
     - different glacier area on finidat file vs. what's in CISM
       (greater than roundoff-level diffs)
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Roundoff-level for different PE layout, larger than roundoff but
      should be same climate when there is different glacier area on the
      finidat file vs. what's in CISM

      The differences arise from dynamic landunit adjustments of the
      below-ground C and N states in the old code, as CTSM adjusts its
      areas to match CISM's. In the new code, there are no C and N
      adjustments in the first time step from this adjustment.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: Rework water data types to accommodate isotopes and other tracers

Purpose of changes
------------------

This tag reworks the various water data types to allow having multiple
instances of variables that are needed for isotopes and other water
tracers.

Specific changes include:

(1) Separated "water state" variables into state, diagnostic and balance
    check-related variables. This separation was not essential for the
    work here, but was desired by Martyn Clark and others.

(2) For each of water state, diagnostic and flux variables, separated
    variables into those needed for both bulk and tracers vs. those only
    needed for bulk. This way, we can have multiple instances of the
    variables needed by tracers, but only a single instance of variables
    that only apply to bulk water. This follows the design laid out in
    https://github.com/escomp/ctsm/pull/395. The separation was based
    largely on what was done in the old water isotope branch; we didn't
    put a lot of thought into this, because the new design allows us to
    easily migrate variables between bulk-only and bulk-and-tracer as
    needed.

(3) Moved water fluxes that were defined in science modules back into
    waterflux_type or waterfluxbulk_type. This was needed for (2); there
    is more discussion on this in
    https://github.com/escomp/ctsm/pull/395 and the log message for
    commit 711e5cd7.

(4) Introduced a top-level water_type that holds instances of all of the
    other water-related objects. This follows the design laid out in
    https://github.com/escomp/ctsm/pull/395. This is particularly
    valuable for the tracer instances: the logic related to number of
    tracers can be encapsulated in water_type, rather than infiltrating
    clm_instMod.

(5) Added placeholders for water tracer instances

(6) Added infrastructure to generate history / restart field names for
    the tracer instances. Eventually, the isotope class can also hold
    information specific to each isotope.

This work was a joint effort between Mathew Rothstein and myself; Mat
gets much of the credit for the actual refactoring done here.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- Fixes #358 (Separate WaterStateType into multiple types)
- Fixes #434 (Separate WaterFluxType into a base class and a class that just applies to bulk)
- Fixes #359 (Set up infrastructure for multiple instances of WaterState and WaterFlux types)
- Fixes #458 (Implement handling of history and restart variables for water tracers)

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include github issue ID):
- #464 (Some lines longer than 132 characters)
- #456 (Remove backwards compatibility check for snw_rds) (not a
  newly-introduced issue, but it's more important to fix this with the
  separation of waterstate_type)

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):
- Water tracers are not yet functional - they are just placeholders
- Whether to use water tracers and which water tracers to use are
  currently hard-coded; eventually, this should be namelist-controlled

Changes to tests or testing: none

Code reviewed by: Mathew Rothstein and Bill Sacks worked together on
these changes and reviewed each other's changes to some extent. The
high-level design was also reviewed and co-developed by Mariana
Vertenstein. Martyn Clark contributed substantially to the breakout of
water state into state, diagnostic and balance check-related variables.

One-line Summary: Fix NFIX flux variables so special land-units are zeroed out, tools update, add some *_MAX fields on mksurfdata_map for transient cases

Purpose of changes
------------------

Nitrogen Fixation flux arrays were being set to missing value over non-vegetated landunits. This sets them to zero everywhere
and averages in the zero's at the gridcell level for history output. It also reads in restarts with missing values and converts
them to zero's.

There are also some tools updates, getting the tools working on the new upgraded hobart.cgd.ucar.edu.

And mksurfdata_map is updated to add some *_MAX files on the landuse.timeseries files that will allow us to conserve memory
for transient cases.

One-line Summary: Begin separating SoilHydrology flux calculations

Note the new tag naming: Starting with this tag, we are naming tags
"ctsm..." rather than "clm...". We are starting with ctsm version 1,
which for now is nearly the same as clm version 5. We are moving to this
new tag naming now because:

(1) The changes in this tag represent the first step towards
    implementing the CTSM vision (separating the biogeophysics flux
    calculations from state updates, making it easier to plug in
    alternative parameterizations, etc.).

(2) This tag changes answers relative to the CLM5 release. (We expect
    the climate to be the same, but we haven't tested this carefully
    yet.)

Purpose of changes
------------------

First steps toward separating various flux calculations in the soil
hydrology code. The focus here is on saturated surface runoff and
infiltration excess runoff. The changes here separate flux calculations
from state updates and extract various calculations into their own
subroutines to facilitate swapping in alternative parameterizations.

Most of the changes here are refactorings that are either bit-for-bit or
just introduce roundoff-level differences. However, there are also a few
larger answer changes, as described below.

These are the greater-than-roundoff-level answer changes:

(A1) Use full qflx_surf in BGC code. Previously, the subroutines ch4 and
     SoilBiogeochemNLeaching had been using a flux that excluded surface
     water runoff (qflx_h2osfc_surf). That was deemed to be incorrect
     (by Dave Lawrence and others), so these BGC subroutines have been
     changed to use the full surface runoff (saturated excess runoff +
     infiltration excess runoff + h2osfc runoff).

     Configurations affected: BGC compsets

     Magnitude of change: Larger than roundoff; expected to be same
     climate, but not investigated carefully

(A2) VIC: Don't ever use the TOPModel formulation for SurfaceRunoff

     The code was using the TOPModel-based formulation for SurfaceRunoff
     if frost_table > zwt_perched. Sean Swenson felt this shouldn't be
     done, and refactoring will be easier if VIC always uses the
     vic-looking formulation, so I'm stopping applying this formulation
     when using VIC.

     Configurations affected: VIC compsets

     Magnitude of change: Larger than roundoff; not investigated carefully

(A3) VIC: Remove infiltration excess runoff

     Martyn Clark reviewed the VIC implementation, and felt that the
     current implementation of infiltration excess runoff is
     inconsistent with the standard VIC implementation. It appears that
     what was being called VIC's infiltration excess runoff was actually
     just an attempt to give a better numerical approximation to the
     solution for saturated surface excess runoff. So deleting this
     leaves only a first-order approximation to VIC's saturated surface
     excess runoff.

     Eventually we may want to put in place a more accurate solution for
     VIC's saturated surface excess runoff. But Martyn's feeling is that
     this can come in with other changes we want to make regarding
     numerical solutions in CTSM.

     Configurations affected: VIC compsets

     Magnitude of change: Larger than roundoff; expected to be same
     climate, but not investigated carefully

(A4) Change in QOVER diagnostic field: now includes QH2OSFC.

These are the major refactorings (either bit-for-bit or just
roundoff-level differences):

(R1) Extract surface runoff to its own module, and other modularization
     related to what used to be subroutine SurfaceRunoff: extract a
     subroutine for each fsat method, move urban surface runoff code
     into different routines.

(R2) Extract infiltration excess runoff to its own module, and other
     modularization related to what used to be subroutine Infiltration.

which changed changed answers, see the file ChangeLog_branch which was
deleted from this branch shortly before it was merged to master.

Changes to tests or testing:
- Shortened a 25-month f19 test to 13-months
  (SMS_Lm13.f19_g17.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-cropMonthOutput):
  This test took a long time to run, and we already have long tests of
  this configuration at coarse-resolution. I suggested removing this
  test entirely, but Erik Kluzek wanted to maintain a shortened version
  of it. Erik's comments were:

     How about either flip it to f45 (because Rosie is using that
     resolution for science) -- or leave it at f19 and have it run for 9
     months? The 25 months was to take it just past the 2-year spinup
     time. From spunup initial conditions 9-months pretty much does a
     full harvest cycle. f19 and f09 are the main configurations for
     science and it would be good to have something longer than just
     really short tests.

  I decided on Lm13, because this still completes in significantly less
  than 2-hours, and if we're running for 9 months anyway, it seems
  valuable to finish out the year and run a bit into the next year,
  since some crop stuff triggers at the end of the year.

Code reviewed by: Various code reviews done last Fall, when these
changes were first implemented.

CLM testing:

  build-namelist tests:

    cheyenne - not run

  unit-tests (components/clm/src):

    cheyenne - PASS

  tools-tests (components/clm/test/tools):

    cheyenne - not run

  PTCLM testing (components/clm/tools/shared/PTCLM/test):

    cheyenne_intel ---- OK
    cheyenne_gnu ------ OK
    hobart_nag -------- OK
    hobart_pgi -------- OK
    hobart_intel ------ OK

    OK means tests pass, answers change as expected.

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Essentially all (except CLM4)
    - what platforms/compilers: All
